# Welcome to my Github profile! I'm Gabriela Rosario (She/Her)

## Hi there! I'm a current undergraduate student at Stonehill College majoring in neuroscience. Some of my primary research interests include brain and behavior, health psychology, and public health. After completing my undergraduate education, I hope to pursue a graduate degree. During my time in graduate school and beyond, I expect to work with large sets of data and have taken inititave to learn skills in data analysis. I'm currently learning R Programming and you can check out some projects/assignments I have completed in my portfolio repository. One project that touched on the field of neuroscience was my function tutorial which explored the `read.fs.volume` function, which extracts and interprets brain volume data from both MGZ and MGH files.
